# 0x01 Intro

Programming LanguagesÔºàPLÔºâcan not live without Program analysis

Why Need Static AnalysisÔºö

* Program Reliability

  Null pointer dereference„ÄÅmemory leakÔºàmalloc without freeÔºâ

* Program Security

  Private information leak„ÄÅinjection attack

* Compiler Optimization

  Dead code elimination„ÄÅcode motion

* Program Understanding

  IDE call hierarchy„ÄÅtype indication

Static analysis analyzes a program P to reason about its behaviors and determines whether it satisfies some properties before running P

> Rice's TheoremÔºö
>
> Any non-trivial property of the behavior of programs in a r.e. language is undecidable
>
> r.e. (recursively enumerable) = recognizable by a Turing-machine
>
> A property is trivial if either it is not satisfied by any r.e. language, or if it is satisfied by all r.e. languages; otherwise it is non-trivial.
>
> non-trivial properties ‚âà the properties related with run-time behaviors of programs

So there is no perfect static analysis strategy

* Sound  ‚âà  ËØØÊä•
* Complete   ‚âà  ÊºèÊä•

![image-20230402140323081](../.gitbook/assets/image-20230402140323081.png)

But we can make some compromises to reach a useful static analysis

* Compromise soundness (false negatives)
* Compromise completeness (false positives)

![image-20230402140559500](../.gitbook/assets/image-20230402140559500.png)

Mostly compromising completeness: Sound but not fully-precise static analysis

Static Analysis: ensure (or get close to) soundness, while making good trade-offs between analysis precision and analysis speed

How to Do Static AnalysisÔºö

* Abstraction
* Over-approximation
  * Transfer functionsÔºö
    * define how to evaluate different program statements on abstract values.
    * defined according to ‚Äúanalysis problem‚Äù and the ‚Äúsemantics‚Äù of different program statements
  * Control flows
    * flow merging

3-Address CodeÔºà3ACÔºâ

* There is at most one operator on the right side of an instruction
* Each 3AC contains at most 3 address

Address can meansÔºö

* Name
* Constant
* Compiler-generated temporary variable

## Control Flow Graph

* Building Control Flow GraphÔºàCFGÔºâ
* CFG serves as the basic structure for static analysis
* The node in CFG can be an individual 3ACÔºàor a Basic Block „ÄêBB„ÄëÔºâ

Basic Blocks are maximal sequences of consecutive three-address instructions

* It can be entered only at the beginning
* It can be exited only at the end

![image-20230403094033043](../.gitbook/assets/image-20230403094033043.png)

Build CFG through BBs

The nodes of CFG are basic blocks

*  There is an edge from block A to block B if and only if
  * There is a conditional or unconditional jump from the end of A to the beginning of B
  * B immediately follows A in the original order of instructions and A does not end in an unconditional jump
* It is normal to replace the jumps to instruction labels by jumps to basic blocks
* Usually we add two nodes, Entry and Exit
